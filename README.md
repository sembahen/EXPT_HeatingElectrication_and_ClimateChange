<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The technical analysis aimed to:

#### 1) Understanding Long-Term Patterns:
   We aim to analyze patterns in peak load, total load, loss of load, and the seasonality of these phenomena,driven by widespread heat pump adoption of Heat Pumps alongside climate change.

### 2) Use Extensive Scenario Analysis:
  Explore a wide range of future scenarios, including variations in climate and technology pathways, to capture the uncertainty associated with these long-term changes. In total, 2560 simulation years.

### 3) Use a validated open source DC OPF model(reproducibility)
  Use an open-source nodal power system model of the ERCOT system to simulate and understand the potential impacts on market prices, reliability, and relative   capacity requirements. Similar models are available for all interconnections of the conterminous US.

### 4) Assess Grid Vulnerability:
   Assess the vulnerability of the grid to these simultaneous changes, identify potential vulnerability.

### 5) Provide Insights for System Planners:
  Offer results that can assist long-term system planners in anticipating and preparing for potential shifts in grid reliability.
